# Recruitment task - WLC


## Installation

Run `composer install` to install all dependencies.

### Additional info

- Frontend banner can be displayed in a few different way including only PHP
- Scripts and styles are not minified - I assumed that it's not a part of the task
- I used CDN files for some js files - it can be done by using npm and webpack
